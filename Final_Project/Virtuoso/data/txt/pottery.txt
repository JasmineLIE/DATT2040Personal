Gift Of Greed, 2566

Pottery


Donated by Lucina Odhran, ‘Gift Of Greed’ 

radiates a sickening, Dream-warding aura 

that is non-lethal to humans, but 

deadly to any Dream-based creatures.


As stated by the artist, ‘Gift Of Greed’

was a product of Galanova’s Goblet Project.  

Mrs. Odhran herself coordinated this project’s

efforts to produce artefacts that served 

cosmetic and Dream-protective functions.


Upon touching the artwork, it is said 

that one can peer into visions provided 

by one of the twelve Greed Fey whose 

essence is embedded into the clay of the pottery.
