The Amer Athena, 2898

Dream-Encrusted Gold


Retrieved from Memphis’ temple in the 

Himalayas, coined ‘The Amer Athena’ by 

Stormwarden archivists, the statue depicts 

a female gladiator.  In her hands is a 

shield with gemstone and laurel imagery.

Tucked away in her other hand, unseen by 

the viewer, is a knife.


Texts retrieved from Memphis’ temple reveal 

the statue’s history.  After having been sold 

off by Ahdia Amer—heiress of 

Luminitron—before the scourge, the statue 

circulated the Americas before falling into 

Memphis’ possession.


The strange, Dream-like sheen on the statue 

has aided many hypotheses.  One of which 

suggests that the statue may have been an 

ancient member of the Amer dynasty 

swallowed by a stasis-inducing, gold substance.
