Violet Beatrice (b. Unknown)

The Valhallan Synod, 2675

Oil on Canvas 


Depicting the first Synod meeting open to the 

public.  Featuring the leaders of Valhalla’s 

factions, and their honorary guests.  This 

painting is a duplicate of the original 

which was vandalised after the usurpation 

of Doyle ‘Judas’ Vance.  Rumour has it 

that all digital copies were also purged 

in the Knights of the Red Letter’s attempt 

to control the narrative of the city’s history. 
 

The original painting had depicted Angelo of 

Hyperia pointing accusationally towards 

another Synod member, which would later 

spark the infamous ‘Blood On The Synod Floor' 

incident of 2675.  It is said that Beatrice’s 

original depiction of the Synod meeting had 

details captured to even the most minute 

gesture.  So much so that Stormwarden 

archivists claim her work of each 

Einherjar’s expression was a foreshadow 

of their intent and underlying allegiance.
